# ðŸš€ Quality-First CI/CD Pipeline - Overview

> **Note:** This is a reference overview. For complete documentation, see [CICD_PIPELINE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](../CICD_PIPELINE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Pipeline Philosophy

This pipeline prioritizes **code quality and testing** over deployment automation, making it perfect for:
- Teams without immediate app store deployment needs
- Quality-focused development workflows
- Internal/enterprise applications
- Open source projects

## ðŸ”— Key Components

### **Pipeline Stages**
1. **Static Analysis** â†’ Code quality and security
2. **Testing Suite** â†’ Unit, widget, integration, golden tests
3. **Coverage Analysis** â†’ Quality gates and reporting
4. **Performance Monitoring** â†’ Build metrics and optimization
5. **Build Automation** â†’ APK/AAB artifact generation

### **Quality Gates**
- Static analysis must pass (dart analyze with fatal warnings)
- Unit tests must execute successfully
- Build artifacts must generate without errors
- Code formatting must comply with Dart standards
- Coverage threshold configurable (default: 70%)
