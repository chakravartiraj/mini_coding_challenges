## üí° **Pro Tips for Daily Use**

### Command History
- Use `‚Üë` and `‚Üì` arrows to navigate command history
- Use `Ctrl+R` to search command history
- Use `history` command to see all previous commands

### Tab Completion
- Press `Tab` to auto-complete file and directory names
- Double-tap `Tab` to see all possible completions
- Works with command names too!

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+C`: Stop current command
- `Ctrl+L`: Clear screen (same as `clear`)
- `Ctrl+A`: Go to beginning of line
- `Ctrl+E`: Go to end of line

### Safety Tips
- Always use `pwd` to confirm your location before dangerous operations
- Use `ls` to verify what you're about to operate on
- Start with `-i` (interactive) flag when learning `rm`
- Test commands on copies or test files first
