- **Release APK** files for distribution
- **App Bundle (AAB)** files for Play Store
- **Build metadata** and summaries

## 🎛️ Quality Gates & Enforcement

### **Enforced Quality Standards:**
1. ✅ **Static Analysis** - Must pass without fatal warnings
2. ✅ **Unit Tests** - Must execute successfully
3. ✅ **Build Success** - Must generate artifacts without errors
4. ✅ **Code Formatting** - Must follow Dart style guidelines
5. ⚠️ **Coverage Threshold** - Configurable minimum (default: 70%)

### **Failure Handling:**
- **Clear error messages** with actionable recommendations
- **Partial success reporting** when some stages fail
- **Artifact preservation** even on failure for debugging
- **Detailed logs** for troubleshooting

## 🚀 How to Use This Pipeline

### **Immediate Use (5 Minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
flutter pub get
cd android && bundle install && cd ..

# 2. Test locally
./scripts/pre-commit-quality-check.sh

# 3. Run full pipeline locally (optional)
cd android
bundle exec fastlane --file QualityFastfile master_quality_pipeline

# 4. Push to trigger GitHub Actions
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
git push origin main
```

### **GitHub Actions Execution**
- **Automatic:** Triggered on push/PR
- **Duration:** 25-45 minutes (parallel execution)
- **Feedback:** Real-time in GitHub Actions UI
- **Artifacts:** Available for 30-90 days

### **Local Development Workflow**
```bash
# Before committing code
./scripts/pre-commit-quality-check.sh

# If issues found, fix them and run again
dart format lib/ test/
dart fix --apply
flutter test

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push
```
