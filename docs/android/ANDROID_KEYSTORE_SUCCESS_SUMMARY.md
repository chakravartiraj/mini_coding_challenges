## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Password Security
- ✅ Minimum 8 characters required
- ✅ Warnings for missing uppercase, numbers, symbols
- ✅ Password confirmation required
- ✅ No passwords logged or stored in scripts

### File Security
- ✅ Keystores stored in secure `~/keystores/` directory
- ✅ File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ `.gitignore` rules prevent version control commits
- ✅ Separate storage from project files

### Operational Security
- ✅ Interactive scripts prevent automation mistakes
- ✅ Verification steps confirm successful creation
- ✅ Training materials educate on best practices
- ✅ Documentation emphasizes security throughout

## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### For Development Teams
1. **Train all developers** using `./scripts/keystore-training.sh`
2. **Standardize on the interactive script** for keystore creation
3. **Implement regular verification** using `./scripts/verify-builds.sh`
4. **Follow the complete guide** for production deployments

### For CI/CD Integration
1. **Store keystore as base64 secret** in GitHub/GitLab
2. **Use environment variables** for passwords
3. **Automate verification** in build pipelines
4. **Implement keystore rotation** procedures

### For Production Deployment
1. **Create separate production keystores** with longer validity
2. **Implement proper backup procedures** with encryption
