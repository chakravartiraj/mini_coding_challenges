# ✅ Build Release Local Script - Creation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Created

### **New Script: `build-release-local.sh`**
- **Location**: `scripts/build-release-local.sh`
- **Purpose**: Build signed release APK and AAB artifacts
- **Features**: Auto-detects project root, validates keystore, creates timestamped artifacts

### **New Fastlane Lane: `build_release_artifacts`**
- **Location**: `android/fastlane/Fastfile`
- **Purpose**: Handle release builds with dynamic versioning
- **Features**: Release APK/AAB generation, timestamped copies, build metadata

### **Enhanced Functions**
- **Updated**: `scripts/build-functions.sh` - Added release build functions
- **Updated**: `android/fastlane/Fastfile` - Enhanced to support both debug and release
- **Updated**: Documentation with release build instructions

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Basic Usage:**
```bash
# From anywhere:
/home/io/StudioProjects/mini_coding_challenges/scripts/build-release-local.sh

# From project root:
./scripts/build-release-local.sh

# From scripts directory:
./build-release-local.sh
```

### **With Build Functions:**
```bash
# Source the functions first:
source scripts/build-functions.sh

# Then use:
build-release                    # Build release artifacts
build-release-and-verify        # Build and verify
```

### **Alias Setup:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc:
alias build-release='cd /home/io/StudioProjects/mini_coding_challenges && ./scripts/build-release-local.sh'

# Then just run:
build-release
```

## ⚠️ Prerequisites for Release Builds

### **Required Setup:**
1. **Keystore File**: Create or obtain a production keystore
2. **Key Properties**: Configure `android/key.properties`
3. **Signing Credentials**: Valid store/key passwords and alias

### **Configuration File (`android/key.properties`):**
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=your_key_alias
storeFile=path/to/your/keystore.jks
```

### **Create Keystore (if needed):**
```bash
./scripts/create-keystore.sh
```

## 📦 Output Artifacts

### **Release builds create:**
- **APK**: `build/app/outputs/apk/app-release-TIMESTAMP-COMMIT.apk`
- **AAB**: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release-TIMESTAMP-COMMIT.aab`
- **Metadata**: `build_info.json` with release build information

### **Verification:**
```bash
./scripts/verify-builds.sh
```

## 🔄 What Was Enhanced

### **Fastlane Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `build_release_artifacts` lane
- ✅ Enhanced `copy_artifacts_with_timestamp` for both debug/release
- ✅ Updated `create_build_info` to support build types
- ✅ Added build type parameter support

### **Script Features:**
- ✅ Auto-detects project root (works from any directory)
- ✅ Validates keystore configuration before building
- ✅ Creates timestamped artifacts in correct locations
- ✅ Provides comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- ✅ Includes security reminders for production builds

### **Documentation Updates:**
- ✅ Enhanced `BUILD_SCRIPT_USAGE.md` with release build instructions
- ✅ Updated main `README.md` with release build commands
- ✅ Added release functions to `build-functions.sh`

## 🎉 Summary

The `build-release-local.sh` script is now ready and provides:

1. **Easy Execution**: Run from anywhere with auto-detection
2. **Safety Checks**: Validates keystore before building
3. **Professional Output**: Signed, timestamped artifacts
4. **Complete Workflow**: Build → Copy → Verify → Report
5. **Security Aware**: Includes production build reminders

The script matches the debug version's usability while adding the necessary safeguards and requirements for production release builds.
